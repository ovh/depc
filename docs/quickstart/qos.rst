Step 2 : Compute your QOS
=========================

The **Apache** and **Filer** nodes represent some servers in real life. In
this case we can analyse data in TimeSeries databases, populated by some
probes. Let's see how to do that !

Create the Source
-----------------

DepC can analyse datapoints from a TimeSeries database to compute a QOS.
The first step is to declare a **Source** : it’s basically an URL and a
token used to communicate with the Timeseries database.

DepC only supports **OpenTSDB** and **Warp10** databases for now, but
others will be included in the tool.

But in this quickstart we’ll use a third type of database : the **Fake** one.
We created it for the purpose of this tutorial. This source generates
data on the fly, so you can test DepC without having real probes sending
datapoints into a TimeSeries database.

Go to the Source tab of your team and create a source named
*Tutorial* using the *Fake* plugin :

   :alt: Fake Source

.. note::
   Please note you don't have to add extra parameters, like url or tokens, but
   it will be the case for other kind of sources.

Create The Checks
-----------------

A check is a Python function that queries a source, retrieves the
datapoints and uses it to compute a QoS percentage. Please read the
:ref:`dedicated guide <checks>` for more information about the checks.

Thanks to the *Fake* source we have 2 probes which create the following metrics :

-  **depc.tutorial.ping** : the probe launches a ping every 300 seconds
   and returns the response time (in milliseconds).
-  **depc.tutorial.oco** : the probe checks the OCO status every 300
   seconds.

.. note::
   The OCO probe is an internal probe which returns 200 if everything is OK,
   and 300 if the service is down.

Here are the corresponding checks :

+-------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+
| Name        | Type      | Parameters                                  |
+=============+===========+=============================================+
| Server Ping | Threshold | Metric: depc.tutorial.ping / Threshold : 20 |
+-------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+
| Server OCO  | Threshold | Metric: depc.tutorial.oco / Threshold :299  |
+-------------+-----------+---------------------------------------------+

The checks can be created in the **Checks** tab. For example this is the
creation form of the **Server Ping** check :

.. figure:: ../_static/images/quickstart/check_server_ping.png
   :alt: Server Ping

Create The Rule
---------------

A rule is simply a group of checks (a check can be added in multiple
rules). We are going to create the **Servers** rule which will contain
our **Server Ping** and **Server OCO** checks :

1. go to the *Rules* tab, click on the *Create a new rule* button and
   create the **Servers** rule.
2. click on the *Associate a check* button, select the wanted checks and
   click on the *Apply* button.

.. figure:: ../_static/images/quickstart/attach_servers_checks.png
   :alt: Rule Filers Result

The rule is now ready and can be launched. In the *Rules* tab, fill the
name with **filer1** and click on the **Launch Checks** button to
execute the rule and its checks. You can display the details of the
checks by clicking on the blue button under the *Actions* column :

.. figure:: ../_static/images/quickstart/rule_launched_summary.png
   :alt: Rule Filers Result

Click on the **Display details** button get more information about your
check :

.. figure:: ../_static/images/quickstart/rule_details_server_ping.png
   :alt: Check Server Ping Details

We can see that some datapoints **exceed our threshold**, so the QOS for
Server Ping is **99.792%**. Likewise the QOS for Server OCO is
**97.708%**.

.. note::
   Please note the whole QOS is **97.5%** because we use a ``AND``
   operation between the checks of the rule. More information about
   the operations in the :ref:`dedicated guide <queries>`.
