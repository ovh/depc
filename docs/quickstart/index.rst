.. note::
   The goal of this quickstart is to show you the main
   usage of DepC : manage your dependencies and compute their QOS.

**The Context**

We are member of the ACME team. Our role is to host the websites of our
customers. So we manage the storage of their files and some web servers.

**The Graph Model**

We split our nodes into four different categories : **Offer**,
**Webhosting**, **Filer** and **Apache**. In DepC a category is called a
**label** (this term comes directly from the Neo4J
`terminology <https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/introduction/graphdb-concepts/#graphdb-neo4j-labels>`__).

The relationships between our labels are represented with the following
graph :

   graph TB;
       A(Offer)-->B(Website);
       B-->C(Filer);
       B-->D(Apache);

**Create your Team**

Most actions in DepC are done within a team, so you must already be part
of one or multiple team to play with DepC. A user can be a member, an
editor or a manager of a team.

.. warning::
   Only DepC administrators can create new teams for
   now, so please ask your admin to do it.

Once your team is created, youâ€™ll be able to find it on the DepC home
page :
